    <h1 class="poem-title text-center">The story of hands</h1>
    <p class="poem-content text-center">
        She was born with hands that loved to feel,<br>
        To touch the world and know what was real.<br>
        Not content with mere sight or sound,<br>
        She sought the textures of life all around.<br><br>

        They wanted her to craft machines of steel,<br>
        To measure the world, to design, to heal.<br>
        But her fingers longed for the unexpected, the free,<br>
        For things that could shift, flow, and be.<br><br>

        She chose the path where mechanics collide,<br>
        With the art of creation where the hands decide.<br>
        Gears and metal, she learned with care,<br>
        Not for their order, but the spaces left bare.<br><br>

        Then she found clay—a world she could mold,<br>
        A journey of shapes that refused to be told.<br>
        She made "Echo of Dreams" on a spinning wheel,<br>
        A pot that sang of all she could feel.<br><br>

        She loved the crooked, the uneven beat,<br>
        The left-handed letters, the imperfect feat.<br>
        A life that embraced all that was flawed,<br>
        A dance in the rough, where beauty is raw.<br><br>

        And always, the scent of kebabs filled the air,<br>
        A taste of home, of hands that prepare.<br>
        Food that was felt, tasted, and shaped,<br>
        Like pottery, a creation of grace.<br><br>

        In every texture, in every twist,<br>
        She found herself in the things she had kissed.<br>
        For her name held a secret, a morning so fine—<br>
        "Sahar" the dawn, and "Naaz" its design.<br><br>

        A beautiful beginning, in love with the hands<br>
        That shaped her own story, unplanned.

        <p>
          Hey guys,
          <br><br>
          I hope you like the poem and the video. Here are a few interesting facts about the video and especially the person in it, Saharnaz.
          <br><br>
          Saharnaz is one of the coolest people I have met. She completed her Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Art History. She realized she was meant to do more and wanted to put her technical skills to use, which led her to join the MS CTD course at CU Boulder.
          <br><br>
          In the video, the music playing in the background is her favorite song, and the images are initially in black and white. This is intentional, as I wanted to show how uncertain she felt about engineering because it was not her first choice. She worked hard, persevered, and eventually found herself. As the video progresses, the pictures become bigger and more colorful to depict this transformation.
          <br><br>
          I've also tried to showcase her culture and philosophy as much as I can—be it the kebabs she loves to eat or the wonderful pottery she has worked on. She enjoys asymmetric things, thinking outside the box, and has a peculiar fondness for odd numbers because she believes that life is unpredictable, and one should embrace it as such.
          <br><br>
          Everything she has chosen in her life reflects her desire to feel the physical world around her and recreate it with her own essence and magic. Hence the title, "The Story of Hands," which illustrates how her experiences have shaped her perspective and made her the person she is today.
